          <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <h3>Aaron Caridakis</h3>
            <p>My name is Aaron Caridakis and I am 18 years old. I graduated high school from Werribee Secondary College and now I am completing further studies at RMIT as a first year, doing the Bachelor of Information Technology (BP162). I was born in Australia and have Indonesian / Greek parents however, I can only speak English. In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, watching Korean dramas and playing video games. But I have one hobby which I hold close to me, baseball. My interest in baseball began around 12 years old after my father encouraged me to play. I used to play for the Newport Baseball Club, however I stopped due to an injury. I have a natural strong interest in IT due to the enjoyment I find in playing video games with friends. I don’t have much experience working in the IT industry.</p>
            <h3>Ali Arbaboun</h3>
            <p>My name is Ali Arbaboun, 18 years old and I come from Iran. This is my first year at RMIT pursuing my passion for Information technology. My interest in IT comes from multiple aspects of the industry, such as the security aspect (Cyber Security), the idea of ‘ethically’ hacking, to find the weakness in code and prevent Cyber-attacks as well as Artificial intelligence. My interest in IT began when I started to volunteer at a community center to solve their IT issues when it came down to live streams. My experience in IT also developed through a year 10 excursion to an IT event that sparked my interest in IT. My hobby is playing ‘professional’ indoor soccer on the weekends.</p>
            <h3>Gabriel Arancibia</h3>
            <p>My name is Gabriel Arancibia (Gabe for short), and I am 19 years old. I graduated from Taylors Lakes Secondary College and am now continuing my education in a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in Australia, and I have Italian/Chilean parents, and currently trying to learn Spanish. Some of my favourite hobbies consist of reading, playing soccer, video games and music production. My interest in IT grew as I was doing a software development class, in which creating programs and designing how they function was a main part of the class and fascinated me, as also was learning about ethical hacking to safeguard people’s systems and hardware from any attacks.</p>
            <h3>Ronald Tran</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ronald (Ron for short) Ray Tran, Student number and email is s3895395@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Australia and am Vietnamese but can barely speak it. I am currently undertaking the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT due to my previous course being discontinued (Bachelor of Business Information Systems (Applied)). My favourite past time is to read Japanese and Korean fiction. </p>
            <h3>William Gardiner</h3>
            <p>My name is William Gardiner. I am an Australian student studying a Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT. My education history consists of completing high school VCE in 2021. I speak English. An interesting fact about me is that I made a film last year (2021) called Clone: the film. My hobbies consist of watching anime, shows and playing games. My interest in IT stems from my enjoyment of games and VR (Virtual Reality), that is the main reason for my interest. My experience with IT is minimal but consists of using IT daily through my computer and phone.</p>
            <h3>Zaeem Furqan</h3>
            <p>I am a current Australian resident however I was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan until the age of 12 when I moved to Australia. Education-wise I have successfully completed year 12 at Berwick College and I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT. The languages I speak include English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi. Now for the interesting fact about myself: Well to sum it up-My family nearly had to go through my death when I portrayed symptoms of “Death Rattle” trying to fight Dengue Fever. My favourite sports are categorized in order as Cricket on top and basketball and soccer plus table tennis to follow.</p>

            <p>Overall, the personality tests each individual conducted showed varying results, even with this being the case, there were many areas in which we all shared multiple traits. The large majority of our group have strong team-work attributes which would be incredibly helpful within a team scenario. Attributes include being open-minded, easy-going, levelheaded and able to take on responsibilities. The information gathered from our personality tests will be helpful for our group as we will be able to examine, compare and relate to each other. This will ensure that we understand how everyone prefers to work and we will have an easy time suiting everyone's needs.</p>

            <p>Machine Learning engineer was not found in the Top Burning Glass occupations of 2017-2018, I assume due to the niche nature of the career compared to the others. For these careers, our group’s required skill set can be broken down into general skills which are communication, problem solving, writing, teamwork, planning, learning and self-management. Our group also has a required skill set for our own specific jobs which is specific to IT. Overall each group member regardless of what job they are doing must have a high aptitude for communication, problem solving in the specific area, be able to work efficiently and productively in a group along with being able to manage themselves, learn on the job and have decent handwriting. Our IT specific skill sets are dependent on the jobs chosen and are shown below in:</p>
            <div class="data_1">
              <ul>
                <li>IT System Administrator - Microsoft365, Wireshark, Procmon, Fiddler, Azure, Software and hardware maintenance experience, ADFS / SSO. </li>

            </div>
            <p style="color: #FCFC;">Most of the IT skills the group members need are very niche and are not shown in the Skills in Greatest Demand via Burning Glass 2017 - 2018 data. Skills such as SQL, Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, ITIL, Python and System engineering are featured in the list, which are skills some of the group members require for their respective jobs. The main generic skills that are required by our jobs rank high and show up on the Top Generic Skills in demand via Burning Glass 2017 - 2018. Skills such as communication, problem solving, organization, writing and teamwork are all present and all rank the highest among employers. The three highest ranked IT related skills that are not in our required skills are JavaScript, JAVA and Project management. The three highest ranked generic skills that are not in our required skills are detail oriented, creativity and leadership. After looking at the Burning Glass data my desired job (Cloud Engineer) has not changed. This is due to it being one of the most desired jobs and ranked very high in the Top IT Job titles by Burning Glass as system engineer. </p>

            <h2>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h2>
            <h3>What does it do?</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is a new form of modern currency that exclusively exist on a digital or virtual platform. Unlike regular currencies, cryptocurrencies do not have a central regulating authority (a single system that monitors and manages all different transactions). Instead, cryptocurrencies will use a decentralised system to record new transactions and issue new units. 
              What separates cryptocurrency to conventional money is the tangibility of the currency as well as the method of security. As cryptocurrency isn’t tangible, individuals who own cryptocurrency own a “key” to a “wallet” which is how you access the cryptocurrency you own. On a security basis, cryptocurrencies use a method of “encryption” to verify transactions. The aim of this encryption is to provide security and safety. 
              The encryption used in cryptocurrency varies between different cryptocurrency. For example, the most well-known cryptocurrency: Bitcoin uses a mathematical technique used for a type of encryption based on elliptic curves; also known as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The main advocacy for cryptocurrency stems from this security. It is estimated that current computers are unable to break the encryption in Bitcoin. This emphasis on safety and security is why there is a cultural shift for money to be acquired virtually. 
              There are several different cryptocurrencies that exist in today’s market. The most recent and well-known one are: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Polkadot and Dogecoin. Cryptocurrency like any other currency can also be traded. As a result, huge sums of money exist in the cryptocurrency market. As cryptocurrency is quite novel in current technology and economy, it is known as quite volatile in the stock market. This means trading with cryptocurrency can lead to massive growths and losses in revenue for traders. It is important that this currency should be further developed to ensure a more stable trading market as well as improving economy in society. 
              Cryptocurrency is tightly linked to a concept and technology called blockchain. In simplistic terms, blockchain is a system of recording information that makes it incredibly difficult to change or hack the system. The hype around the blockchain technology stems from the fact that it solves one of the prevailing issues surrounding digital currency: the issue of trust. As blockchain is a database where the users run the database instead of a normal database such as an SQL database where there is  s a centra authority that monitors the system, it means that there is a consensus of mutual trust amongst the users in the blockchain network. 
              Talking about blockchain in technical terms, the decentralised database that is blockchain is also known  as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Each participant of a blockchain has a ledger (block). When a new transaction occurs in the blockchain, it is recorded to every participant’s ledger. Cryptocurrency which uses this blockchain technology records the transactions with an immutable cryptocurrency signature, also known as a “hash”. The implication of immutability is that if a single “block” or ledger is altered or changed for malicious intent, it would immediately become noticeable that there was tampering of the system. 
              A common comparison with blockchain is the conventional bank. There are many who have presumed that blockchains may replace brick and mortar banks in the future but there are many differences. While there are apparent benefits with a blockchain, such as a faster transaction speed, ease of transfers as well as a complete sense of anonymity, there are other concerns such as a difficulty of government tracking (not knowing who runs what account means it may be difficult to seize it). This type of cultural view may shift in the future.</p>
              <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
              <p>If blockchain technology is implemented into the financial banking sector, payment security, transparency and efficiency can improve as blockchain is a shared ledger technology where everyone can see the status and history of transactions which can help clients and firms work together more efficiently. This technology has potential to replace centralized banking with a decentralized system but with the uncertainty and big banks and government not in favor of this technology, this is unlikely to happen.
                The use of blockchain technology can also improve cyber security as the blockchain network is resistant to hacks and unauthorized changes due to being encrypted with advanced cryptography. The blockchain network also allows individuals to directly perform transactions with one another through a single distributed ledger instead of relying on a third party which would be more susceptible to vulnerabilities than the blockchain network.
                Crypto currencies can be used for illegal activities as they some anonymity but if the individual has linked an email or is using an exchange or wallet then the wallet would be traceable to the individual. Crypto currencies can be used in day-to-day life and may even replace countries' currencies but due to the high volatility, make it almost impossible to happen as it is not backed by anything. </p>
              <h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
              <p>Block chain technology can positively affect us as it would increase security when performing transactions of any sort as well as increasing the efficacy and speed of said transactions and processes.
                Crypto currency can positively affect us as it allows us to use another form of currency if the firm/business allows it. Additionally crypto currency can be used as another form of investment with many cryptocurrencies increasing in value over time such as bitcoin and Ethereum which we can use to enrich our lively hood. </p>

              <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
              <h3>What does it do?</h3>
              <p>An autonomous vehicle is a driverless vehicle that is capable of sensing its surroundings and can operate itself and perform necessary functions safely with little or no human input. This is done through the use of high-resolution cameras, light detection and ranging which allows the vehicles to figure out their surroundings. The current state of the art autonomous vehicles would be Tesla Autopilot and GM Super Cruise. Additionally, Mercedes-Benz was the world's first automaker to 'gain internationally valid regulatory approval in producing vehicles capable of Level 3 autonomous or "conditionally automated" driving' (Alvin 2022, para. 1). Currently, by looking at the state of autonomous vehicles, we have already reached impressive milestones as companies such as Aptiv, Yandex and Waymo offer autonomous taxis in dedicated areas. Furthermore, big brands such as tesla have developed Tesla Autopilot, which is a suite of advanced driver-assistance system that amounts to Level 2 vehicle automation. Tesla themselves state that 'Tesla cars come standard with advanced hardware capable of providing Autopilot features, and full self-driving capabilities—through software updates designed to improve functionality over time' (Tesla 2022). Within the upcoming years, Tesla is expected to achieve Level 4 autonomy. Level 4 is considered to be fully autonomous driving where the vehicle can handle the majority of driving situations by itself. Although a human can still request control of the vehicle while in this state. </p>
              <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
              <p>Autonomous vehicles will have a significant impact on society for a number of reasons, some positives include the number of vehicle accidents could be reduced and travel time can be used more effectively due to reduced traffic jams. As we continue to further develop and advance our current technologies, autonomous vehicles will likely reach a state where they will be able to have the full capabilities to drive all on their own without any type of human interaction needed with maximum safety levels. If we do reach this state, roads would overall be safer due to all vehicles being automated designed to drive safely. This will cause fewer accidents caused by human error on the roads. However, this would also impact those working in transport related sectors like car repair centers due to less accidents occurring. Overall, if this advancement comes, it should be expected to make many jobs redundant. Namely jobs such as uber would easily be replaced by autonomous vehicles causing many individuals who drive for uber to lose their jobs. However, there could also be the opportunity to open new jobs regarding the development of these autonomous vehicles. The advancement of autonomous vehicles may cause the demand for human drivers in the transportation sector to disappear. </p>

        <h1>Project <span>Idea</span></h1>
        <div class="project_content">
          <div class="project_text">
            <p>The global COVID-19 pandemic has put surface disinfectants to the test. It has also prompt organizations to develop ultraviolet-disinfection or otherwise known as UV-C robots. These robots are becoming more popular as an option for disinfecting rooms and spaces of all surfaces in one process, and as a result, they are appealing to hospital administrators. This is what I have decided for my project to be as not only is it useful but also less costly than typical workforce. Furthermore, according to R&D, UVC Robots improve sanitization by 60% compared to liquid-based cleaning. The robot moves automatically in a defined area, after being programmed for things like time and distance from surfaces. It is made up of multiple lamps placed on top of a platform. During disinfection, the Robots emit UV-C irradiation at a wavelength of around 200-300 nanometers, allowing for a full 360-degree coverage. During the disinfection process, the robot moves at a steady speed, achieving a coverage of areas at several meters. However, to enable auto moving, the robot must be programmed via the use of a detailed map/blueprint of the hospital or medical clinic.  </p>
            <p>This project to us is very useful as first, it would give me some experience of the key skills required for my dream job. Not only this but as stated above it would also fill the desires of my mum as i technically am working in the hospital. The main motivation behind this however is the need to do something for people. This is a genuine and sad fact that people mostly go to hospital as a way of obtaining medicine or treatment for their illness. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are complications of healthcare and linked with high morbidity and mortality. Each year, about 1 in 25 U.S. hospital patients is diagnosed with at least one infection related to hospital care alone. 1 in 25!!! Can you believe this? For those who even go to a hospital or even a medical clinic for just a regular checkup could come back contracted with the worst of bacteria/infections. Some of the most common infections people transmit across medical clinics include but are not limited to: UTI, pneumonia and even lung infections. The need to help stop this due to lack of staff or lack of care provided, I feel that UV-C robots are the perfect way to transform our hospitals in the future if we genuinely want to save lives. </p>
            <p>Once every aspect is set, furniture and all other objects must remain in the same place to enable an autonomous functioning. Currently, according to my idea and for safety, this UV-C robot automatically shuts off when its motion sensor detects any moving things (whether it is a human or a vase falling) during the disinfection process. Despite the ultimate recommendations, manual cleaning in each hospital is based mostly on local protocol and cleaning staff’s private opinions, as well as the control and the inspection of their performance.  </p>
            <p>Evidence further suggests that manual cleaning and disinfection are often inadequate and result in contamination (which we know to be true). Besides killing microorganisms on surfaces, disinfection robots automatically record the operation parameters of the disinfection process and by this, can provide efficiency and effectiveness assurance. Advantages of these robots also include but are not limited to disinfection will work in an unmanned manner, without the need for ongoing human presence at the disinfection site. Therefore, exposure of health care workers to harmful UV radiation can be avoided during the process. Applying UV-C as a final disinfection step after manual disinfection provides an additional hygiene benefit to reducing cross-transmission and associated infections which I mentioned above. UV light does not leave any residues, making this an environmentally friendly disinfection method. However, with every innovation comes limitations that I think this project would have been the need for some sort of pre-cleaning for the program to fully work during the initial launch and length of time and affect to safety regulations. </p>
            <p>Skills required for this project are also self-explanatory. We need some basic math & science for the measurement of various aspects and error prevention. We also need basic building and sort of engineering skills, furthermore we should be aware of how to work drills. For this project we need C, C++, and Python while I try to figure out what else we need. Not 100%, but we may require basic A.I (Artificial Intelligence) and M.L (Machine Learning) (Machine Learning) system understanding. </p>
            <p>If you have read all the above, you might be thinking how innovative this is. Well, our business model is simple, instead of making obnoxiously sized and pricey robots, we would rather be making miniature models of the same project for a less costly price. Therefore, money input towards the project < total profit. So, for example, instead of a hospital purchasing a large machine to clean up a smaller surface area, they could purchase 2, 3 of our smaller models to clean up the room which would not only be effective but also efficient for both me to make money and the hospital to save money. Research suggests that the production cost of each robot without labor could easily cost $50+ per robot. Now if I were to produce one that's ⅓ of the size of an obnoxious one, you would estimate that my production cost would be around $15. Now those companies making their robots for $50+ are selling their product for around $600, which hospitals are hesitant to buy as workforce per hour is cheaper. However, the aspect most hospitals do not realise is that the purchase of a robot is permanent whereas staff changes require depending. If I were to turn this idea into a business, I'd potentially look to profit at least $75 per robot, meaning selling the robot that cost me $15 for $100. Now think to yourself, would companies buy 1 large robot for $600+ or 1 for $100 and add on as many as they want based on their demands. Not only this but this would speed up the process by around 50% as there could be robots working in multiple rooms at a time. </p>
            <p>If the project is successful, one downgrade would be that some cleaners would lose their job however this would be less impactful than a patient losing their life to the mistakes of that same cleaner. The success of this project would mean a tough competition for its competitors such as VIOMI or HOBOT. The original problem would be solved as according to google and various other sites, successful UVC robots have been proven to have a 99% success rate. This development would basically mean less deaths or illness because of involuntary actions and a way for us to pave our way into the future. This technology could also give birth to more innovative ideas that would be useful for the sustainability of this planet. </p>
