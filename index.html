          <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <h3>Aaron Caridakis</h3>
            <p>My name is Aaron Caridakis and I am 18 years old. I graduated high school from Werribee Secondary College and now I am completing further studies at RMIT as a first year, doing the Bachelor of Information Technology (BP162). I was born in Australia and have Indonesian / Greek parents however, I can only speak English. In my spare time I enjoy listening to music, watching Korean dramas and playing video games. But I have one hobby which I hold close to me, baseball. My interest in baseball began around 12 years old after my father encouraged me to play. I used to play for the Newport Baseball Club, however I stopped due to an injury. I have a natural strong interest in IT due to the enjoyment I find in playing video games with friends. I don’t have much experience working in the IT industry.</p>
            <h3>Ali Arbaboun</h3>
            <p>My name is Ali Arbaboun, 18 years old and I come from Iran. This is my first year at RMIT pursuing my passion for Information technology. My interest in IT comes from multiple aspects of the industry, such as the security aspect (Cyber Security), the idea of ‘ethically’ hacking, to find the weakness in code and prevent Cyber-attacks as well as Artificial intelligence. My interest in IT began when I started to volunteer at a community center to solve their IT issues when it came down to live streams. My experience in IT also developed through a year 10 excursion to an IT event that sparked my interest in IT. My hobby is playing ‘professional’ indoor soccer on the weekends.</p>
            <h3>Gabriel Arancibia</h3>
            <p>My name is Gabriel Arancibia (Gabe for short), and I am 19 years old. I graduated from Taylors Lakes Secondary College and am now continuing my education in a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I was born in Australia, and I have Italian/Chilean parents, and currently trying to learn Spanish. Some of my favourite hobbies consist of reading, playing soccer, video games and music production. My interest in IT grew as I was doing a software development class, in which creating programs and designing how they function was a main part of the class and fascinated me, as also was learning about ethical hacking to safeguard people’s systems and hardware from any attacks.</p>
            <h3>Ronald Tran</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ronald (Ron for short) Ray Tran, Student number and email is s3895395@student.rmit.edu.au. I was born in Australia and am Vietnamese but can barely speak it. I am currently undertaking the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT due to my previous course being discontinued (Bachelor of Business Information Systems (Applied)). My favourite past time is to read Japanese and Korean fiction. </p>
            <h3>William Gardiner</h3>
            <p>My name is William Gardiner. I am an Australian student studying a Bachelor of Information technology at RMIT. My education history consists of completing high school VCE in 2021. I speak English. An interesting fact about me is that I made a film last year (2021) called Clone: the film. My hobbies consist of watching anime, shows and playing games. My interest in IT stems from my enjoyment of games and VR (Virtual Reality), that is the main reason for my interest. My experience with IT is minimal but consists of using IT daily through my computer and phone.</p>
            <h3>Zaeem Furqan</h3>
            <p>I am a current Australian resident however I was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan until the age of 12 when I moved to Australia. Education-wise I have successfully completed year 12 at Berwick College and I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Information Technology course at RMIT. The languages I speak include English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi. Now for the interesting fact about myself: Well to sum it up-My family nearly had to go through my death when I portrayed symptoms of “Death Rattle” trying to fight Dengue Fever. My favourite sports are categorized in order as Cricket on top and basketball and soccer plus table tennis to follow.</p>

          <h5>Personality Tests Analysis</h5>
          <div class="test_help">
            <p>Overall, the personality tests each individual conducted showed varying results, even with this being the case, there were many areas in which we all shared multiple traits. The large majority of our group have strong team-work attributes which would be incredibly helpful within a team scenario. Attributes include being open-minded, easy-going, levelheaded and able to take on responsibilities. The information gathered from our personality tests will be helpful for our group as we will be able to examine, compare and relate to each other. This will ensure that we understand how everyone prefers to work and we will have an easy time suiting everyone's needs.</p>
